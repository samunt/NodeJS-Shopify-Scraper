Welcome to the Shopify scrape for NodeJS!

Use this as a starter application to effectively scrape a Shopify website. You can run it from the console, or deploy it with a cronjob to scrape and save data to your DB around the clock!

1. Find all the "TODO"s throughout the application to see what info you need to update
2. To start the app run "npm i" then "node app.js"
3. The app.js file has the NodeJS stuff, the scraper.js file has the Shopify scraping stuff
4. I left the cron.yaml file in, so if you decide to deploy, pay attention to its endpoint "/schedule" as relates to the app.js file
